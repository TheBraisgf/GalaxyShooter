# Galaxy Shooter

Welcome to my personal Galaxy Shooter repository! This Unity project is exclusively for my own learning purposes. Within this repository, I'm developing a 2D space shooter game where you take control of a spaceship and navigate through the cosmos.

This project is my personal journey into game development. By exploring the code and assets, I aim to gain valuable insights into Unity game development, including game mechanics, scripting, and asset management. My ultimate goal is to leverage this knowledge to create my very own video game by 2024.

Feel free to browse through this repository as I experiment with the code and develop my skills in Unity game development. It's a space for my own growth and learning in the world of game development.
